# BitBurner

While looking for games that help with coding/automation mindset I discovered Bitburner.

Bitburner is an incremental / idling game where you can write js (javascript) using a library called ns (netscript) to hack a 2077 cyberpunk world.

## What are these files anyway?

These are my net scripts I've been using to automate the discovery and hacking of targets in the game. Using the dev in game instructions and the dev tools I continue to improve them.

I have tried my best to figure everything out from the in-game instructions but have used the dev tools and the docs a few times to obtain knowledge. I think it's in the spirit of the game to do so, but I've been trying to challenge myself since this gamification of coding has turned out to be really fun.

## TODO


* automate backdoor / reach singularity / go for it.
* Fix main.js and work.js to work from new file / full reset
* Save config to localstorage, config flags
* Improve time stamps
* Calculate how long jobs take, how many weakens, grows till ready.
* What makes more servers appear for discovery? Hack level or what?
* Complete a contract to see what rewards are like
* move work logic up another level, there are only three work orders
    we can save space because of the cost these in memory
    if the main.js knows, or can learn, the server security and money
    that should be passed along to the work order as needed.
* move to TODO list to issue tracking, oof! such work-game. ;-)
