# BitBurner

While looking for games that help with coding/automation mindset I discovered Bitburner.

Bitburner is an incremental / idling game where you can write js (javascript) using a library called ns (netscript) to hack a 2077 cyberpunk world.

## What are these files anyway?

These are my net scripts I've been using to automate the discovery and hacking of targets in the game. Using the dev in game instructions and the dev tools I continue to improve them.

I have tried my best to figure everything out from the in-game instructions but have used the dev tools and the docs a few times to obtain knowledge. I think it's in the spirit of the game to do so, but I've been trying to challenge myself since this gamification of coding has turned out to be really fun.

## TODO

* save config to localstorage, config flag
* automate backdoor / reach singularity.
* work script has data calls that could be replaced with hard numbers to save ram.
* move to github issue tracking?
* Print the time, so we can more easily check how long work has been going. TODO improve this, we can calculate how long jobs take and print them rather
rather than just getting the default output
* TODO, move work logic up another level, there are only three work orders
we can save space because of the cost these in memory
if the main.js knows, or can learn, the server security and money
that should be passed along to the work order as needed.
