# BitBurner

While looking for games that help with coding/automation mindset I discovered Bitburner.

These are my scripts I've been using to automate the discovery and hacking of targets in the game.

## Thoughts about the game:

Since last Augmentation installation

7 hours 9 minutes 3 seconds

Total

2 days 14 hours 18 minutes 19 seconds

It's the 30th of Oct 2023 now, I've been playing for two days or so, I had some tiem tonight to rework almost everything about the way main launches work. Now to make it smarter...

I'll update my todo list, but I think I'm making good progress and my js skills are coming back.

I've been playing for about an entire day now, mainly tinkering on my scripts and discovering what I can do. I have the whole network mapped out I think, and I discover it automatically as I get access to more servers. I've found a good way to get back on my feet after Augmentation installs too. When I next "install" or reset, which I think would be best to do in the morning, I'll see how hands-off I can be. The biggest missing piece is automation for picking my target. It's a mess because I don't know all the details right now, so I've just been picking some targets I found manually and aimming all my servers at them.

Probably time to review the docs and check my todo list in main.js
